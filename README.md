# Advent of Code 2023
If you're reading this, you're probably browsing a bunch of Advent of Code repos... welcome!

I'm using this to learn Swift, with a lot of help from Copilot. Sometimes Copilot gives me great suggestions, sometimes... not so much. Such is the way of language models.

I did this with Rust last year (see [`threeifbyair/advent2022`](https://github.com/threeifbyair/advent2022) ... not that I finished; maybe I should go back and do that!) and if I have time, I'll add Rust code for this year too. That's why you'll see a little bit of Rust sprinkled in. (Although not as much rust as my car had earlier this year... sore point!) 

If you want to run my code, use:

    swift run Advent2023 -i input/<day>.txt <day>

or, for part two:

    swift run Advent2023 -i input/<day>.txt -p <day>

Have fun and let me know if you want to exchange ideas!
